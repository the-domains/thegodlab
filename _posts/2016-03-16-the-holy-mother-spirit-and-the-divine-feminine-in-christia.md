# [THE HOLY (MOTHER) SPIRIT AND THE DIVINE FEMININE IN CHRISTIANITY][0]

There is a perception that Christianity lacks female characters that are venerated at the same level as Jesus or God the Father. But if you look a little deeper into Christian tradition, you might find that there is a female aspect to God, namely, The Holy Spirit.

Traditional Christians believe God has three aspects: the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, aka The Trinity. While the Holy Spirit is normally seen as having no gender, I'm going to make the argument that the Holy Spirit is both feminine and a symbol of divine motherhood and wisdom.

To that end, I think the term The Holy "Mother" Spirit is a more fitting term. I mean, isn't Father, Son and Mother a more a universal kind of trinity anyway?
